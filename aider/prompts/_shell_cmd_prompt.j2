Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
{{ platform }}
